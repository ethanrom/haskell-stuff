## Haskell Control Systems

This repository contains implementations of two control systems in Haskell: the Kalman filter and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control system.

### Kalman Filter
The Kalman filter is a widely used algorithm for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system from noisy measurements. This implementation uses the state-space model and Kalman filter equations to estimate the state of the system.

### LQR Control System
The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control system is a widely used control method that minimizes a quadratic cost function subject to a linear dynamic system. This implementation calculates the optimal control law using the LQR formula.

Code was used as a starting point for a control systems project
